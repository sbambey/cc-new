### Overview

The application has two major components:

1. Managing users, airlines and their opportunities (Admin, User, Airline, Fly models)
2. Automatically determining the consistency of opportunities with the use of rake tasks (ScrapeNodeSet, ScrapeNode, AdminNotice models)

### Testing

The first major component is fully tested, while the second is not fully tested. At the moment it is at a stage where I am not exactly sure what the final implementation will look like. TDD is delayed until it becomes more clear what the implementation will look like.
